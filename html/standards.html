<h2>Essay Question: Standards?</h2>
<p>I do not think that page authors should use non-standard additions to HTML because those standards create structure.
   While some may believe that standardization limits creativity there is more benefit to creating standards. It reduces
   redundancy within the web since everyone uses the same set of standards people are not reinventing the wheel.
   It helps browsers be able to function more efficiently since developers are building browsers to only have to work with
   a certain set of rules. Due to standardization search engines are able to optimize their searches and code is more easily
   validated. It is also important to have standards because of accessibility reasons if there was not those standards many
   of the programs (such as voice browsers) used by individuals with disabilities would not be able to work.  Standardization
   also helps with browsers being able to innovate and remain relevant while still being compatible to older versions. There
   is an exception to using non-standard additions and that is if those additions are currently proposed specs in the non-finalized
   version. These could be used but the developer should provide provisions for non-compatible browsers. If the user does not have a
   browser that works they should be mindful of the type of experience that user has. Trying out newly proposed specs is actually a good
   thing because it is a way to test out and see how these new additions will work in the wild but that should not come at the expense of the casual user. </p>
